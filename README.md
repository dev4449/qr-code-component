## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learn much by completing this challeng because I used my existing knowledge to complete it. I'm not sure if the font css properties, specifically, those I had to copy over from other sources and not specified by the Frontend Mentor challenge, are correct and I generally don't know how much should I learn and develop skills for typography and fonts as a frontend engineer.

I do welcome and appreciate hints on where I can improve. Thanks for reviewing my work.

### Continued development

I believe I need to learn flexbox and grid deeply and gain knowledge and develop skills on accessibility semantic HTML.
